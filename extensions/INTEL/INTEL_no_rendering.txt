Number

    OpenGL Extension #521
    OpenGL ES Extension #300

Dependencies

    OpenGL dependencies:

        OpenGL 3.0 is required.

        The extension is written against the OpenGL 4.6 Specification, Core
        Profile, July 30, 2017.

    OpenGL ES dependencies:

        This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 3.2 Specification,
        November 3, 2016.

Overview

    The purpose of this extension is to allow an application to disable all
    rendering operations emitted to the GPU through the stream of commands. All
    hardware units involved in the 3D pipeline are configured as expected but no
    rendering operation is triggered (i.e. vertices are not processed, shaders
    are not run, etc...)

    Such a feature can be useful to figure out whether a workload is CPU bound.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

      #define GL_INTEL_no_rendering 1

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <target> parameter of Enable, Disable, IsEnabled:

        NO_RENDERING_INTEL  0x83FC

Additions to the OpenGL 4.6 (Core Profile) Specification

    Modify section 2.4 Rendering Commands (add new text at the end of the
    section)

    The above commands can be turned into a NOOP in the steam of commands sent
    to the GPU through enabling NO_RENDERING_INTEL.

Additions to Chapter 14.2.2, Shader Inputs of the OpenGL ES 3.2 Specification

    Modify section 2.4 Rendering Commands (add new text at the end of the
    section)

    The above commands can be turned into a NOOP in the steam of commands sent
    to the GPU through enabling NO_RENDERING_INTEL.

Additions to the AGL/GLX/WGL Specifications

    None.

GLX Protocol

    None.

Errors

    None.
